# Introduction

## What is Benchmark

Benchmark is an App that allows you to find Benches in no time. This App is perfect for nature enthusiasts and of course for everyone who needs to find a seating accommodation quickly. As well you are able to add Benches with our "Add a Bench" funtion, to add Benches that are not already listed on the Map. You are also able to climb the Leaderboard by adding Benches.

A lot of credit goes to "OpenStreetMaps" for making this whole project possible.

# Add a Bench

You can use this feature to mark benches on the map that have not yet been integrated in our system and thus helping us and others to make the app more usable.

# Leaderboard

When you mark Benches on the Map you can enter a Nickname and climb the Leaderboard.
