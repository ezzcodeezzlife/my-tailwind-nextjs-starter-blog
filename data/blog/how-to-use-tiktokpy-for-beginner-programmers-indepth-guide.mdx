This tutorial will show you how to use TikTokPy Python Bot. First you need to install a few prerequisites.

# Install prerequisites

## Install Python 3

I recommend to install Python 3.6.5 or higher.
[Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you have problems with installing Python, you can use the tutorial:
[realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

## Install Git version control

[Download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install Google Chrome Browser

[Download it here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_en/chrome/)

Now you have everything to get started with tiktodv3 Python Script.

# Get started

## Clone the repository from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudoguy/tiktokpy.git
```

or download the zip file from the GitHub repository and unzip it.

## Change directory

```bash
cd tiktokpy
```

Now you should be in the directory tiktodv3.
There should be some files in this directory:

```
tiktokpy
quickstart.py
README.md
...
```

## Install modules

```bash
pip install tiktokpy
pip install playwright-stealth
```

This should install all the modules you need.

## Run the Script

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

```python
import asyncio
from tiktokpy import TikTokPy


async def main():
    async with TikTokPy() as bot:
        # Do you want to get trending videos? You can!
        trending_items = await bot.trending(amount=5)

        for item in trending_items:
            # ‚ù§Ô∏è you can like videos
            await bot.like(item)
            # or unlike them
            await bot.unlike(item)
            # or follow users
            await bot.follow(item.author.username)
            # as and unfollow
            await bot.unfollow(item.author.username)

        # üòè getting user's feed
        user_feed_items = await bot.user_feed(username="justinbieber", amount=5)

        for item in user_feed_items:
            # üéß get music title, cover, link, author name..
            print("Music title: ", item.music.title)
            # #Ô∏è‚É£ print all tag's title of video
            print([tag.title for tag in item.challenges])
            # üìà check all video stats
            print("Comments: ", item.stats.comments)
            print("Plays: ", item.stats.plays)
            print("Shares: ", item.stats.shares)
            print("Likes: ", item.stats.likes)

        # and many other things üòâ


asyncio.run(main())
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
| INFO | ü•≥ TikTokPy initialized. Version: 0.9.0
| INFO | üîß Settings in path directory not found "C:\Users\pc\Desktop\tiktokpy\settings.toml". I'll create default settings here: C:\Users\pc\Desktop\tiktokpy\settings.toml
| INFO | üîß Settings successfully loaded
```

You have to be logged into your Tiktok Account in your Browser to go from

```bash
| INFO | üõë Cookies not found, anonymous mode
```

to

```bash
| INFO | ‚úîÔ∏è Cookies found, logged in
| INFO | üìà Getting trending items
| INFO | üìà Getting @justinbieber feed
...
```
