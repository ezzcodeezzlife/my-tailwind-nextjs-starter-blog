This tutorial will show you how to use tiktodv3 Script Python. First you need to install a few prerequisites. Also make sure to check me out on [GitHub for more Python projects](https://github.com/ezzcodeezzlife).

# Install prerequisites

## Install Python 3

I recommend to install Python 3.6.5 or higher.
[Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you have problems with installing Python, you can use the tutorial:

## Install Git version control

[Download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install Google Chrome Browser

[Download it here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_en/chrome/)

Now you have everything to get started with tiktodv3 Python Script.

# Get started

## Clone the repository from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezzcodeezzlife/tiktodv3.git
```

or download the zip file from the GitHub repository and unzip it.

## Change directory

```bash
cd tiktodv3
```

Now you should be in the directory tiktodv3.
There should be 3 files in this directory:

```
tiktodv3.py
README.md
requirements.txt
```

## Install modules

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should install all the modules you need.

## Run the Script

```bash
python tiktodv3.py
```

## Select the mode with input

You are asked to select the mode. Just type the number of the mode you want to use.

```bash
1. Viewbot.
2. Heartbot.
3. Followerbot.
4. Sharebot.
```

Then input the Tiktok video url

```bash
