This tutorial will show you how to use instahack Python Script. First you need to install a few prerequisites.

# Install prerequisites

## Install Python 3

I recommend to install Python 3.6.2 or higher.
[Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

f you have Python installed then the easiest way you can check the version number is by typing "python" in your command prompt. It will show you the version number and if it is running on 32 bit or 64 bit and some other information.

If you have problems with installing Python, you can use the tutorial:
[realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

## Install Git

[Download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

If you want to learn more about Git version control, you can read this:
[git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

To check whether or not you have git installed, simply open a terminal window and type "git --version".

# Get started

## Clone the repository from GitHub

This clones a repository into a newly created directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mark0909099/instahack.git
```

or download the zip file from the GitHub repository and unzip it.
You could also use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository.

## Change directory

```bash
cd instahack
```

Now you should be in the directory instahack.
There should be some files in this directory:

```
README.md
hackinsta.py
pass.txt
...
```

We mostly care about the hackinsta.py file

## Fill pass.txt

You will need to fill the file with various combinations of passwords.

## Run the script

```bash
python hackinsta.py
```

# Enjoy!

## If you have further questions or problems with the script, please open an issue on GitHub or write a comment below:
